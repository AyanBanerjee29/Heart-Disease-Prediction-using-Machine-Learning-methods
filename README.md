# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using various clinical and demographic features from the Heart Disease Dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). Early and accurate detection of heart disease can save lives and reduce medical costs.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 14 features that represent patient health information:

| Feature    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| age       | Age of the patient (in years) |
| sex       | Sex (1 = male; 0 = female) |
| cp        | Chest pain type (0–3) |
| trestbps  | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) |
| chol      | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl |
| fbs       | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) |
| restecg   | Resting electrocardiographic results (0–2) |
| thalach   | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| exang     | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) |
| oldpeak   | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| slope     | The slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| ca        | Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| thal      | Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect) |
| target    | Presence of heart disease (1 = disease; 0 = no disease) |

## 🚀 Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Checked for missing values and basic dataset information.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical and numerical features appropriately.
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
- Verified data distributions and class balance.

### 3. Model Building
- Split the data into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
- Trained multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV where applicable.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the models using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
  - ROC Curve & AUC Score

### 5. Conclusion
- Identified the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
- Discussed potential areas for further improvement.

## 📝 Summary:

| Model                  |
|-----------------------|
| Logistic Regression    | 
| K-Nearest Neighbors    |
| Support Vector Machine |
| Decision Tree          | 
| Random Forest          |
|Voting Classifier (LogReg, RF, SVC, AdaBoost)|

> **Note:** Exact numerical values for Random Forest and Voting Classifier are detailed in the notebook. These models achieved the best performance specifically in terms of **Recall**, which is crucial in this healthcare context to minimize the risk of undiagnosed heart disease cases.

> **Model Selection Criterion:**  
> The models were evaluated primarily based on **Recall** to reduce the risk of False Negatives (patients with heart disease wrongly classified as healthy), as missing such cases can have severe medical consequences. The Random Forest and Voting Classifier models were thus selected for their superior recall performance.
